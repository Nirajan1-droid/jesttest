output of a react component at a particular point in time.snapshot are typically used for visual regression testing to 
ensure that the UI of a component or application doesn't change unexpectedly.
/tree as const storing snapshot later it is compared with the prev value of tree(saved in snapshot) to the newly changed structure . if the change is unintentional then snapshots comparision fails indicates the changes occured where and what did that.
expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
testing framework captures the current structure of "tree" as the snapshot at the first time.
